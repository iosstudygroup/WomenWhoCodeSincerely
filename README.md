# Women Who Code... Sincerely

## Current Branch

Choose a file from filepicker and print out a postcard!

## Overview

We are making an iPhone Postcard App using our sponsor's API.
Sincerely's Ship API is highly awesome and enables you to take pictures and send physical postcards to real human beings!
