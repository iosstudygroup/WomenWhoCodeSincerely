# Women Who Code... Sincerely

Current Branch: This is a very basic example of Sincerely. You can
send a Women Who Code postcard by pressing the button!

## Overview

We are making an iPhone Postcard App using our sponsor's API.
Sincerely's Ship API is highly awesome and enables you to take pictures and send physical postcards to real human beings!
