## Overview

We are making an iPhone Postcard App using our sponsor's API.
Sincerely's Ship API is highly awesome and enables you to take pictures and send physical postcards to real human beings!

Meetup at Sincerely, April 12, 2013

This is a work in progress. Branches will be structured to follow a logical lesson plan.



### ConsumerCredentials.h

* Create a file named ConsumerCredentials.h
* Add API keys for these constants like so:

                #define kSincerelyAPIKey @"stuff"

                #define kFilepickerAPIKey @"stuff"


* plist - add the API keys for filepicker and Aviary

# Nice to Have
* A Category extension UIButton+NiceButton.h that would custom center the text on the UIButtons we use (they're currently off margin because there's shadow in the graphic we use as the background)
